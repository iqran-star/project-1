She received Pakistan's highest literary award, the Presidential Pride of Performance, from General Pervez Musharraf in 2005. A science park in Lahore, the Arfa Software Technology Park, was named in her honour.[4][5][6][7] At the age of 10, Randhawa was invited by Bill Gates to visit Microsoft's headquarters in the United States.[8] She died on 14 January 2012, aged 16, from a cardiac arrest.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Muhammad Ali Jinnah was a barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death.
                He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-i-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is observed as a national holiday in Pakistan.
                Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice.
